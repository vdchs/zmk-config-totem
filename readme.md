# A push to making even fewer keys work
## The general idea behind this layout
This layout makes heavy use of combos for everything that is not on the alpha layer.

In my head I tend to distinguish between 2 kinds of combos: two-finger-combos and thumb-combos. The former are a concept that worked really well in my 22 key version, the latter are new to this layout and the cornerstone of getting the number of keys down even further than before.

This amount of combos comes with a lot of domnsides and just leaving it at that would result in a layout that is - frankly - bad. In order to mitigate the problems and elevate the layout to a usable one, I made use of adaptive keys (and some other neat tricks). The resulting layout comes with a substantial learning curve but a big payoff: it is my smallest layout so far; and should - in theory - still allow for typing speeds well above 100 wpm.

I am not quite there yet. This is very much a work in progress and does not type as smoothly as the 22 version.

Oh yeah, and this layout does feel a bit like playing DDR. 

## Layers
### alpha
#### alpha base
```
m    g    d    p        l    u    o    y
c    s    t    h        n    e    a    i
               r        _
```

#### alpha held
```
gui  •    •    •        •    •    •    gui
num  sym  ctl  alt      alt  ctl  sym  num
               Roll     nav
```

#### alpha two-finger-combos
```
• q  • ß  • z  •        • ex • ü  •    •
•os-⇧• f  • b  •        • .  • '  •os-⇧•
               •   rr   •
```
There is one more combo for entering the `func` layer by pressing both the pinky and index finger on one hand. (1+4 or 7+10)

#### alpha thumb-combos
```
•    j    •    •        •    •    •    • 
x    v    w    k        ,_   ,    •    •
               ★       ★
```
All these combos only work with the same side thumb, so keys on the left half are paired with the left thumb key and vice versa.

#### alpha r-roll layer
```
•    rj   •    •        •    •    •    •
rx   rv   rm   rk       •    •    •    •
               •        •
```
This is basically there to avoid awkward bigrams where the right thumb `r` is followed by a thumb-combo-letter. It enables me to just roll the keys instead.

### num
#### num base
```
•    .    (    )        7    8    9    •
•    3    2    1        4    5    6    •
               0        _
```
#### num two-finger-combos
```
•    •    • [  •        • ]  •    •    •
•    • <  • {  •        • }  • >  •    •
               •        •
```

### sym
#### sym base
```
%    @    |    &        _    +    `    ^
#    $    ?    !        -    =    :    ;
               /        •
```
#### sym held
```
•    •    •    •        •    •    ~    •  
•    •    •    •        ->   =>   •    end+;
               \        •
```
#### sym two-finger-combos
```
•    •    •    •        •    •    •    •
•    • *  •    •        •    •    •    •
               •        •
```

### nav
```
gui  tab  pgdn pgup      home end  del  •
esc  bsp  ctl  alt      ←    ↓    ↑    →
               ⇧        •
```

### func
```
•    vold volu mute     pscr f11  f12  •
f1   f2   f3   f4       f7   f8   f9   f10
               f5       f6
```
